	Mankind is at war with the Strogg, a hostile alien race that attacked Earth. <br />
	In response, humanity launched a strike on the Strogg homeworld...it failed, but you survived. <br />
	Outnumbered and outgunned, fight your way through fortified military installations and <br />
	shut down the enemy's war machine. Only then will the fate of humanity be known.<br />
