	<title>Spaghetti Tower</title>

	<p class="text">Our icebreaker challenge was to make a tower out of spaghetti to hold up a marshmallow.
	<br />We only had 18 minutes, and 20 strips to work with alongside tape. Although it didn't
	<br />work exactly, we managed to get something that ended up working, without using tape
	<br />during the last few minutes.</p>
